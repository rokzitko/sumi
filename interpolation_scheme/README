pink1: 1/f noise, no interpolation
pink2: 1/f noise, with interpolation
white1: white noise, no interpolation
white2: white noise, with interpolation

In the absence of interpolation: the spectrum decreases as S(f) \propto f for all frequencies below the repeat frequency 
of FFT blocks. Interpolation smooths this out (weaker than linear decay).
